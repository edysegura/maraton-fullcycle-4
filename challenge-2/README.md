# Challenge Information

Throughout the Marathon we will use containers as a basis for development as well as for production. So, having a basic notion of Docker is more than necessary.

In this challenge, you will have to create a docker image that, when executed, should expose port 8080 displaying the message: I am Full Cycle.

Stay free to use the technology / programming language of your choice. Example: you can create a simple application using Node.js with Express to display this message. Generate your image build.

If you have never had any experience with docker, we recommend that you attend the following class: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2udL9GG2U
